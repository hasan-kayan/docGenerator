In VsCode here how you can do it:

- Open the command palette (Ctrl+Shift+P)

- Type "Preferences: Open Settings (JSON)" and select it

- Add the following line to the settings.json file:

"editor.formatOnSave": true

- Save the file and close it

Now, every time you save a file, it will be automatically formatted.

Ok how you can do this by terminal, run a C++ code by terminal ?

- First, you need to install g++ compiler. You can do this by running the following command:

sudo apt-get install g++

- Now, you can compile your code by running the following command:

g++ -o outputFileName inputFileName.cpp

- Finally, you can run your code by running the following command:

./outputFileName

That's it! You can now run a C++ code by terminal.
